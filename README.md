# Pokedex

## Description

Pokedex is an Android application that offers Pokémon enthusiasts a rich and engaging experience. It provides a comprehensive list of Pokémon, allowing users to explore detailed information about each creature.

The app's user interface was thoughtfully crafted based on the design inspiration available on [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/shots/6545819-Pokedex-App). This design served as a visual guideline, ensuring the creation of an app with a user-friendly and visually appealing interface.
